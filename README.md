# Recipes for Vaadin

A collection of solutions to common use cases you run into when developing business web applications.

All solutions should be of the type "The user of my app wants to ..." and focus on functionality.

Solutions are implemented using Java, TS or a mix that is appropriate. The focus is on the solution, not how it is implemented.

The project is deployed at https://recipes.vaadin.com

## Contributing a recipe

To contribute a recipe, you need to do the following:
1. If you want to avoid problems with other people contributing the same idea at the same time, create or find an issue describing the intent (one sentence is typically enough) and accept the issue
2. Fork and clone the project
3. Add the recipe using the following locations as needed:
 * Java in `src/main/java/org/vaadin/recipes/nameofyourrecipe/`
 * CSS and TS in `frontend/recipes/nameofyourrecipe/`
4. Commit and create a PR
5. Wait for 1-2 days for somebody to react to the PR
6. Fix any potential comments
7. :tada:
